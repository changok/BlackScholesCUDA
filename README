Tips:

1. I've included a PBS script skeleton which is tuned for this
   particular homework.  You'll still need to edit it though.  Please,
   please, read all the comments!

2. Add dcmt0.4/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH in both the shell in which
   you work, and the PBS script.  You'll notice that the PBS script
   example that I've given you does this already.

3. I've gotten the Mersenne Twister (MT) PRNG to work!  You're welcome
   to benchmark with either the MT or the system PRNG.  Note that in
   the Makefile, I've added -DUSE_MERSENNE_TWISTER to CFLAGS.  Comment
   this whole line out if you'd rather try the system PRNG.  

4. Valgrind is a very useful tool which is installed on the PSI cluster.
   Google it and learn how to use it.  It's really easy to use and it 
   can help you catch a lot of nasty C bugs that are hard to find by 
   other means.
